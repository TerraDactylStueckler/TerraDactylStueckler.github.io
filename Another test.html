    <p>This is getting rather frustrating. I'm not sure what else I can do to get this to 
        work. I've sent a message to the rest of the students for support, but I'm seriously
        considering ditching this whole idea. I would definitely have a lot more time to do 
        other things in my life and a whole pile less of frustration.
