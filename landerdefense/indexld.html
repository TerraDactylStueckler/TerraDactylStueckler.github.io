          After the Aurora Colorado Theater shooting, it became obvious that the gunman could have been easily stopped if only a
          very few people in the crowd had a real fighting mindset.  Not just being a “Good Guy with a Gun”, but having a deep 
          understanding formed from physical experience about what would work and what wouldn’t.  Knowing what to do in a situation 
          like that doesn’t happen on your first time through, but there simply wasn’t any way available to train for it ahead of 
          time, and that needed to change.  There needed to be a real fighting school for civilians, so I built the Lander Defense Team 
          and started running classes.

            You know who you are.  
              You can't stand evil people victimizing the innocent. 
              You are not a policeman.
              You are not a soldier. 
              You want to be able to make a difference if you are needed. 
              Maybe you know how to shoot and already carry a gun, maybe you don't. 
              Maybe you have been trained, maybe you have not. 
              You probably already know that you need to improve on some things.
              Lander Defense is for people like you.
              The Good Guys With Guns program is not a one size fits all "class".  
              It is an individual coaching program designed to reinforce your skills and reveal your weak points so you can work on them.
