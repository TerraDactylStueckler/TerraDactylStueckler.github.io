                <p><strong>Lander</strong> is the county seat of Fremont County. It is named for the
                    transcontinental explorer Frederick W. Lander. It is located in central
                    Wyoming at the base of the Wind River Mountains & is home to many engaging
                    outdoor adventures. Some of these include the Rise & Fall of the Popo Agie
                    River, where the Popo Agie disappears underground & re-emerges less than a mile 
                    downstream from the base of the mountain. Lander also hosts Wild Iris, a renowned
                    mountain climbing venue. Hiking the back trails of Sinks Canyon will take you to
                    the Falls, a beautiful spot high in the mountains where the snow runoff falls
                    down a smooth boulder, perfect for a slide into a clear, cold pool. This is a favorite
                    spot for visitors after a long warm hike.

                <h3>Lander's 4th of July</h3>
                <p><strong>Lander</strong> is the best place to be on the Fourth of July. People come from all over
                    the country to be a part of our celebration. We often see visitors from New York
                    & Alaska. Fireworks are legal in Wyoming & in Lander city limits are allowed all day
                    on the 4th of July. They are allowed to be fired year round outside city limits. You
                    can watch the town light up after dark from a vantage point in the Mount Hope Cemetery.
                    If you've ever wondered what the War for Independence looked like, Lander is your
                    place to visit.
